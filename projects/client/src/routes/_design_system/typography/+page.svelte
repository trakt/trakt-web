  <h1>The artist's journey: from blank canvas to masterpiece.</h1>

  <p>
    The canvas stares back, a blank expanse of terror. Your palette mocks with
    garish pigments, siren songs promising beauty but delivering despair. But
    fear not! Within you lies the spirit of a true artist.

  <p class="italic">
    "They say Helvetica is the font of the future, a typeface so pure it
    transcends emotion. But you know better. You've seen the cracks, the hints
    of despair. You yearn for something with soul."
